# FIU Nuclear Group

The Florida International University (FIU) Nuclear Physics Research Group is at the forefront of advancing knowledge in the field of nuclear physics. The group is engaged in pioneering research that spans both experimental and theoretical aspects of the discipline. On the experimental side, the team conducts high-precision experiments using state-of-the-art facilities and detectors to investigate the fundamental properties of atomic nuclei, nuclear reactions, and the forces that govern them. These experiments often involve collaborations with major research institutions and utilize powerful particle accelerators and other advanced technology.

By combining experimental data with theoretical insights, the group plays a crucial role in pushing the boundaries of what is known about nuclear processes, helping to answer some of the most profound questions in physics today. The research conducted by this group not only contributes to the global scientific community but also provides valuable opportunities for students and young researchers to engage in cutting-edge scientific inquiry. 

This github repository serves as a central hub for our students and collaborators to share their code and provide prospective students with an understanding of what each of our students are currently working on.
